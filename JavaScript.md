# JavaScript

## Basics:  
-case-sensitive  
-use semi-colons to break up lines of code that should be run consecutively
### Strings  
-\t within a string will go to the next tab end.  
-\n will start a new line  
-\\ will show one \ within the returned string  
-" is a special character, so must put a \ in front of it for it to show up within a string  

### Variables  
-Basic Syntax: var trainWhistles = 3  
-Rules: no spaces in variable name, no digits in front, generally try to use camel case, where words are not joined by underscores, but rather the first word is not capitalized and all subsequent words are capitalized.  dollar signs and underscores are usually not used.  
-When changing a variable's value, var does not have to be used because JS already "knows"  
-Each position in a string has a numbered index starting from zero  
-

##Methods  
-charAt(0) retrieves the character at the specific index  
-console.log() outputs results of code operations in files   

##Files  
-JavaScript file is for running JavaScript in someone else's browser  
-to run JavaScript in an HTML file, use <script> tag, within the script tag, specify the file that the JS should be loaded from; the js file should be in the same directory as the html file to function correctly, or should be specified otherwise.
